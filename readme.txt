== Description ==

ACF Engine is a toolkit for building dynamic WP sites and leveraging ACF (Advanced Custom Fields). ACF Engine provides interfaces for registering site assets including custom post types, taxonomies, options pages and Gutenberg blocks.

All assets that you register with ACF Engine are stored as JSON files and can be easily migrated to any other website powered by ACF Engine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin similar to JetEngine by Crocoblocks? =

Yes it is modelled after the JetEngine approach and was inspired by the comprehensive building tools provided by JetEngine. However ACF Engine diverges from JetEngine in two primary ways, first by using ACF exclusively as the meta field hander and secondly by taking a Gutenberg block first approach to rendering.
